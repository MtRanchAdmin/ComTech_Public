    "content": "Hi all, Just a quick heads-up that weâ€™ll be performing routine system maintenance this Saturday night, starting at 11 PM EST. This work is part of regular upkeep to keep things secure, stable, and fastâ€”but it will involve a brief planned outage during the window. What to Expect: Between 11:00 PM and 2:00 AM, you may notice: - Email going offline briefly (Outlook + OWA) - Shared drives and file servers temporarily inaccessible - Internal portals and tools (HR, tickets, ERP) down or slow to load - VPN access interrupted or disconnected for some users What You Should Do: - Save any open work and log off before 11 PM if youâ€™re working late - Donâ€™t panic if you get errorsâ€”services will come back automatically - If you run into issues after 2 AM, report them at: http://status.company.com/report Thanks for your understanding while we run this maintenanceâ€”this helps prevent bigger issues down the road. We'll update the Status Page once everythingâ€™s back to normal. â€“ MikeBrokeIT.com"
